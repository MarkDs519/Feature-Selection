# Feature-Selection
A short example of how to perform Backward Elimination Feature Selection. The dataset used for the example was the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set taken from kaggle.
# Backward Elimination
In backward elimination, we start with all the features and removes the least significant feature at each iteration which improves the performance of the model. We repeat this until no improvement is observed on removal of features.
